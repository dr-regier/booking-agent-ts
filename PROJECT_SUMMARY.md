# Project Summary: AI-Powered Travel Booking Assistant

## Overview

An intelligent travel booking assistant that combines conversational AI with real-time Google Hotels data to provide personalized accommodation recommendations. This full-stack application demonstrates advanced integration of AI technologies, API services, and modern React development practices.

## Problem Statement

Traditional travel planning requires manually searching multiple booking platforms, comparing prices, and evaluating accommodations across different websites. This process is time-consuming, fragmented, and often leads to suboptimal choices due to information overload and decision fatigue.

## Solution

A unified AI-powered platform that:
- Engages users in natural conversation to understand travel requirements
- Intelligently searches Google Hotels with advanced pre-filtering based on user criteria
- Provides personalized accommodation recommendations with AI-powered evaluation
- Presents results in a clean, organized interface with AI-generated insights
