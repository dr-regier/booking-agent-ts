Add minimum criteria validation to enable the accommodation search functionality:

1. Create validation logic that checks if we have the minimum required criteria:
   - Destination (must be present)
   - Check-in date (must be present) 
   - Check-out date (must be present)
   - Number of guests (must be > 0)

2. Update the "Start Accommodation Search" button to:
   - Be disabled/grayed out when minimum criteria are missing
   - Show a helpful tooltip or helper text indicating what's still needed
   - Enable automatically as soon as minimum criteria are collected
   - Examples of helper text: "Need destination and travel dates" or "Please specify check-in and check-out dates"

3. Integrate this validation into the existing travel criteria extraction logic so it updates in real-time as the user chats

4. Make sure the validation is visual and intuitive - users should clearly see their progress toward being able to start a search

5. The button should become enabled immediately when the user provides the final missing piece of information through the chat

Show me what files need to be modified and implement this validation system that works seamlessly with the existing chat and criteria extraction.
