Summary

  I've successfully moved the accommodation search results from the right panel to the main content area with full-sized property cards. Here's what was implemented:

  âœ… Changes Completed:

  1. Moved Results Display:
    - Removed SearchResults from the right panel in page.tsx
    - Results now display in the main content area, replacing the chat when available
  2. Created Full-Sized Property Cards:
    - New dedicated SearchResults component in /components/search-results.tsx
    - Each property card features:
        - Large property image placeholder with gradient background
      - Prominent property name and location
      - Star rating display in top-right corner
      - Detailed description
      - Visual amenity tags with icons (WiFi, parking, coffee, pool, etc.)
      - AI match score with explanation
      - Price per night prominently displayed
      - "Book Now" and "View Details" action buttons
  3. Updated Right Panel:
    - Now focuses solely on progress/status tracking
    - Contains only TravelSummary and SearchAccommodations components
    - No results display in sidebar
  4. Fixed Technical Issues:
    - Updated UIMessage structure to use parts array instead of content field (AI SDK 5 compatibility)
    - Fixed TypeScript errors for role types
    - Installed missing type definitions
    - Fixed regex flag compatibility issues

  ðŸŽ¨ New Layout Features:

  - Main Content Area: Full-width accommodation browsing with detailed property cards
  - Property Cards: Professional layout with image, details, amenities, AI matching, and actions
  - Right Panel: Clean progress tracking and travel criteria summary
  - Responsive Design: Cards work well across different screen sizes
  - Visual Hierarchy: Clear price display, ratings, and call-to-action buttons

  ðŸš€ Status:

  The application builds successfully and is running on http://localhost:3002. The new layout transforms the accommodation search experience from a compact sidebar
  display to a full-featured property browsing interface in the main content area.
