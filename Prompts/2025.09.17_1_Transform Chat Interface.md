I want to transform this general chat interface into a travel planning assistant. Modify the chat to:

1. Add a system message that introduces the assistant as a "Travel Planning Agent" that helps users find accommodations
2. Update the placeholder text to say "Tell me about your travel plans..." instead of the current placeholder
3. Modify the initial greeting to ask users about their travel destination, dates, number of guests, and budget
4. Keep the same chat UI structure but make it feel like talking to a travel agent

Show me what files need to be changed and make the modifications.
