 Perfect! I've successfully enhanced the chat interface to gather additional context for better accommodation results. Here's what I implemented:

  âœ… Enhanced Context Collection System:

  1. Extended TravelCriteria Interface (/lib/types/travel.ts)

  Added 5 optional enhanced criteria:
  - Trip Purpose: business, vacation, romantic, family
  - Location Preferences: nightlife, quiet, walkable, near transit, etc.
  - Property Type: hotel, apartment, house, hostel, unique stays
  - Flexible Cancellation: boolean for booking flexibility
  - Additional Requests: custom user requirements

  2. Smart Enhanced Extraction (/lib/utils/enhanced-extractor.ts)

  - Natural Language Processing for enhanced criteria
  - Context-aware extraction from conversational responses
  - Progressive collection tracking (0-5 enhanced criteria)
  - Intelligent pattern matching for trip purposes and preferences

  3. Progressive Search Enablement

  - Phase 1: Collect 5 required criteria â†’ "Continue conversation to improve results"
  - Phase 2: Collect 1+ enhanced criteria â†’ "Start Basic Search" (outline button)
  - Phase 3: Collect 2+ enhanced criteria â†’ "Start Enhanced Search" (primary button)

  4. Enhanced Travel Summary

  - Two-tier display: Required criteria + Enhanced context section
  - Visual progress: Shows both required (5/5) and optional (X/5) completion
  - Smart hints:
    - "Still need: budget" (required criteria)
    - "Tell me about your trip purpose to improve results" (enhanced criteria)

  5. Conversational Flow Examples

  âœ… Natural Conversation Flow:

  1. Basic: "Going to Paris March 25-28 for 2 people, budget $200/night" â†’ All required âœ“
  2. Enhanced: "This is a romantic getaway" â†’ Trip purpose âœ“
  3. Enhanced: "We want somewhere walkable with nightlife nearby" â†’ Location preferences âœ“
  4. Ready: Button becomes "Start Enhanced Search"

  âœ… Smart Pattern Recognition:

  - "Business trip" â†’ Trip Purpose: business
  - "Family vacation" â†’ Trip Purpose: family
  - "Want flexible cancellation" â†’ Flexible Cancellation: true
  - "Prefer an apartment" â†’ Property Type: apartment
  - "Near restaurants and bars" â†’ Location: nightlife, restaurants

  ðŸŽ¯ Progressive Search States:

  ðŸ”´ Incomplete Required (0-4/5):

  - Button: Disabled "Start Accommodation Search"
  - Message: "Please specify [missing criteria]"

  ðŸŸ¡ Basic Ready (5/5 required, 0-1/5 enhanced):

  - Button: Outline "Start Basic Search"
  - Message: "Continue conversation to improve search results"

  ðŸŸ¢ Enhanced Ready (5/5 required, 2+/5 enhanced):

  - Button: Primary "Start Enhanced Search"
  - Message: "Ready for enhanced search! (X/5 optional criteria)"

  ðŸ§ª Test the Enhanced Flow:

  Visit http://localhost:3001 and try this conversation:

  1. "I'm going to Paris from March 25th to March 28th for 2 people with a budget of $200 per night" â†’ Basic ready
  2. "This is a romantic anniversary trip" â†’ Enhanced context +1
  3. "We want somewhere walkable near good restaurants" â†’ Enhanced context +2
  4. Button becomes "Start Enhanced Search" âœ…

  The system now gathers rich context that will help the Playwright agent make smarter filtering and ranking decisions when searching booking sites!
