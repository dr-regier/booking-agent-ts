Perfect! I've successfully implemented comprehensive validation logic for the accommodation search functionality. Here's what I created:

  âœ… Files Modified/Created:

  1. New Validation Utilities (/lib/utils/travel-validation.ts)

  - Complete validation logic for all 4 required criteria
  - Progress tracking with percentage completion
  - Dynamic validation messages that update based on what's missing
  - Structured validation results with detailed feedback

  2. Enhanced Search Component (/components/search-accommodations.tsx)

  - Visual validation progress with checkmarks and progress bar
  - Tooltip feedback on disabled search button
  - Real-time requirement checklist showing what's completed/missing
  - Button state changes (secondary when disabled, primary when ready)
  - Color-coded progress indicators (green for complete, muted for missing)

  3. Enhanced Travel Summary (/components/travel-summary.tsx)

  - Next missing criteria hints with warning icons
  - Visual feedback for empty states
  - Real-time guidance for users on what to provide next

  4. Improved Criteria Extraction (/lib/utils/travel-extractor.ts)

  - Better date parsing with more flexible patterns
  - Enhanced guest detection from various phrasings
  - Global regex matching for more accurate extraction
  - Support for date ranges and flexible formats

  ðŸŽ¯ Validation Requirements:

  The system now validates these 4 required criteria:

  1. âœ… Destination - Must be present and > 2 characters
  2. âœ… Check-in Date - Must be present and not empty
  3. âœ… Check-out Date - Must be present and not empty
  4. âœ… Number of Guests - Must be > 0 and â‰¤ 20

  ðŸš¦ Real-Time Visual Feedback:

  - Progress bar shows 0-100% completion
  - Checkmarks appear as each requirement is met
  - Button becomes enabled immediately when all criteria are met
  - Helpful tooltips explain what's still needed
  - Color coding: Green for complete, amber for warnings
  - Dynamic messages like "Still need: check-in date"

  ðŸ§ª Ready to Test:

  Visit http://localhost:3001 and try these scenarios:

  1. Start empty - See "Start by telling me your destination" hint
  2. Add destination: "I want to visit Paris" - Progress: 25%
  3. Add dates: "from March 15th to March 20th" - Progress: 75%
  4. Add guests: "for 2 people" - Progress: 100% âœ… Button enabled!

  The validation works in real-time as you chat, and the search button becomes enabled immediately when you complete the final missing requirement!
