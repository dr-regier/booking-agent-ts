The interface looks great but everything appears oversized for efficient screen usage. Need to optimize spacing and sizing for better information density.

**Issues to Address:**
1. **Header height** - Blue gradient header could be more compact
2. **Property card sizing** - Cards are quite tall, could be more condensed
3. **Padding and margins** - Generous spacing throughout reduces screen efficiency
4. **Right panel width** - May be taking too much horizontal space
5. **Overall density** - Low information density means less content visible

**Optimization Goals:**
- Reduce header height while maintaining visual appeal
- Make property cards more compact but still readable
- Optimize spacing throughout for better screen utilization
- Consider making right panel slightly narrower
- Increase information density without sacrificing usability

**Priority:** Focus on vertical space optimization since that's typically the biggest constraint on most screens.

Please analyze the current spacing and sizing, then optimize for better screen efficiency while maintaining the professional travel aesthetic.
