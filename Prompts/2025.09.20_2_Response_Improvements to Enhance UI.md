Perfect! I've fixed both layout issues:

  âœ… Both Layout Issues Fixed

  ðŸŽ¯ Problem 1: Black Textarea - SOLVED

  - Changed container from bg-white to bg-gray-50 for better visual integration
  - Added inline styles with !important to override any competing CSS:
    - backgroundColor: '#f9fafb !important' (light gray)
    - color: '#1f2937 !important' (dark gray text)
    - caretColor: '#1f2937 !important' (dark cursor)
  - Added CSS overrides targeting multiple selectors to ensure the light theme persists
  - Result: Clean, light gray textarea that integrates beautifully with the travel aesthetic

  ðŸŽ¯ Problem 2: Content Overflow - SOLVED

  - Reduced padding: Main container from py-8 to py-4 and welcome area from p-8 to p-4
  - Removed forced height: Eliminated min-h-96 that was forcing unnecessary height
  - Optimized spacing:
    - Welcome card padding reduced from p-8 to p-6
    - Gaps reduced from gap-6 to gap-4
    - Icon size from text-4xl to text-3xl
    - Title from text-xl to text-lg
  - Constrained width: Added max-w-lg to prevent the welcome card from being too wide
  - Result: Welcome content now fits comfortably without scrolling

  ðŸš€ Visual Improvements

  - Better proportions: Content is now properly sized for the available space
  - Cohesive colors: Light gray textarea (#f9fafb) harmonizes with the overall light theme
  - Maintained readability: High contrast dark text (#1f2937) on light backgrounds
  - Professional appearance: Clean, travel-focused aesthetic without jarring elements

  The application now has a perfectly integrated, clean design where:
  - âœ… No black textarea disrupting the light travel theme
  - âœ… Welcome content fits without premature scrolling
  - âœ… All text remains highly readable and accessible
  - âœ… The overall aesthetic remains sophisticated and travel-focused
