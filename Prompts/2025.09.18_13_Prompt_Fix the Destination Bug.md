Fix the destination extraction bug in the travel criteria extraction logic. The system is incorrectly extracting "go to a gym" as the destination instead of "Boracay" (or "boracao phillipines" as the user typed it). 

1. Debug the destination extraction regex/logic to see why it's missing the actual location
2. Improve the extraction to properly identify location names vs activity phrases  
3. Make sure "Boracay" and similar destination names are properly captured
4. Prevent activity phrases like "go to a gym" from being classified as destinations
5. Test the fix to ensure "Boracay" shows up correctly in the Travel Summary

The user clearly mentioned "boracao phillipines" but it's showing "go to a gym" as the destination instead.
