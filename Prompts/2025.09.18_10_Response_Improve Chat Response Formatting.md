Summary

  I've successfully implemented comprehensive AI response formatting improvements:

  1. Updated System Prompt (app/api/chat/route.ts)

  - Added detailed formatting guidelines for the AI
  - Instructed it to use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
  - Requested numbered lists for questions (1., 2., 3.)
  - Asked for bullet points (â€¢) for amenities/options
  - Specified clear response structure with proper spacing

  2. Enhanced Chat Display Styling (app/globals.css)

  - Added .ai-response styles with proper spacing
  - Improved typography with better line height and spacing
  - Styled numbered and bullet lists clearly
  - Added proper paragraph margins and formatting
  - Enhanced readability for long responses

  3. Added Response Processing (lib/utils/format-response.ts)

  - Created smart text processing to split long paragraphs
  - Handles numbered lists and bullet points properly
  - Converts wall-of-text into digestible chunks
  - Maintains paragraph structure with proper spacing

  4. Custom Message Component (components/formatted-message.tsx)

  - Renders formatted text as proper JSX elements
  - Converts numbered lists to <ol> elements
  - Converts bullet points to <ul> elements
  - Maintains proper paragraph structure with <p> tags

  The chat interface will now display AI responses with:
  - Clean, short paragraphs
  - Properly formatted numbered questions
  - Clear bullet point lists
  - Professional spacing and typography
  - Better visual hierarchy

  Test the chat interface - AI responses should now be much more readable and professionally formatted instead of being walls of text.
