The current UI enhancement created an overwhelming purple design that feels too aggressive and gaming-like rather than sophisticated travel-focused. I need to completely revise the visual direction with a better approach.

**Issues to Fix:**
- Purple gradient is too intense and dated
- Black text input breaks design cohesion (we had text visibility issues with transparent inputs)
- Banner feels flat and uninspiring
- Overall doesn't feel like a premium travel/booking experience

**New Visual Direction:**

1. **Travel-Appropriate Color Palette**
   - Replace purple with subtle blue-to-teal ocean-inspired gradients
   - Use warm whites/creams for backgrounds instead of harsh transparency
   - Add soft grays and natural tones that feel sophisticated and travel-focused

2. **Enhanced Banner Design**
   - Create a dynamic travel-themed header with subtle destination imagery (mountain silhouettes, wave patterns, or city skylines)
   - Add animated floating travel icons (plane, compass, luggage) with subtle movement
   - Implement a greeting that changes based on time of day ("Good morning! Ready to plan your next adventure?")
   - Make gradients shift subtly based on conversation context

3. **Proper Text Input Solution**
   - Use solid white background with subtle border for the input field
   - Apply glass effects to the container around the input, not the input itself
   - Ensure high contrast and readability while maintaining modern aesthetic

4. **Refined Glassmorphism**
   - Much more subtle transparency (5-10% instead of heavy blur)
   - Focus on elevation and shadows rather than heavy glass effects
   - Create depth through layering, not just blur

**Design Goals:**
- Feel like Airbnb or modern travel apps - sophisticated, welcoming, travel-focused
- Inviting and warm rather than cold/digital
- Professional but approachable
- Clearly a premium booking experience

Please completely redesign the visual approach with this refined, travel-focused direction that feels sophisticated rather than overwhelming.
