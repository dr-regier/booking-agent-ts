The chat area is showing raw technical data that creates a poor user experience. I need to clean up what gets displayed in the chat while keeping the detailed progress in the right panel.

**Current Problem:**
The AI chat responses are showing raw criteria extraction details like:
- "**Destination:** Boracay 2. **Check-in date:** 10/31 3. **Check-out date:** 11/7..."
- Raw search parameters and technical processing info
- Unformatted accommodation results as text dumps
- Debug-style output instead of clean conversational responses

**Required Changes:**
1. **Hide technical processing from chat** - Don't show criteria extraction details or raw parameters in chat messages
2. **Keep technical details in right panel only** - Progress updates should stay in the detailed progress section
3. **Clean chat responses** - AI should give friendly, conversational summaries like:
   - "Perfect! I'm searching for accommodations in Boracay for your dates..."
   - "I found some great options for you! Here are the top recommendations:"
4. **Show final results as visual cards** - When search completes, display accommodation results as proper property cards with images, ratings, prices, not text dumps

**Goal:**
The chat should feel like talking to a professional travel agent - friendly and conversational. All the technical details and progress tracking should happen in the right panel, while the chat stays clean and user-focused.

Please identify where the raw technical output is being added to chat messages and remove it, keeping only clean, conversational AI responses.
