I want to enhance the UI of this AI booking agent with modern visual effects to make it really pop. Please implement these 4 quick win enhancements while preserving all existing functionality:

1. **Glassmorphism + Floating Cards**
   - Apply glass effects to chat bubbles, sidebar panels, and cards using backdrop-blur-sm, bg-white/10, and subtle borders
   - Elevate all major UI elements with floating card design using shadows (shadow-lg, shadow-xl) and rounded corners
   - Create depth hierarchy with different blur/transparency levels

2. **Typewriter Effect for AI Responses**
   - Enhance the existing streaming text display to show characters appearing one by one as they stream from the API
   - Keep the existing Server-Sent Events functionality intact
   - Add subtle cursor blink effect at the end of typing

3. **Animated Progress with Visual Checkpoints**
   - Replace current progress bar with animated journey visualization showing: "Searching" → "Evaluating Properties" → "AI Ranking" → "Complete"
   - Use animated checkpoints/dots with connecting lines, smooth transitions, and subtle glow effects for active states
   - Keep existing progress percentage logic but enhance visual presentation

4. **Enhanced Hover States & Micro-interactions**
   - Add smooth hover effects: buttons expand slightly with glow, cards lift with increased shadow
   - Animate criteria checkboxes when completed
   - Add 200-300ms transitions throughout

**Technical Requirements:**
- Use only Tailwind CSS classes (no custom CSS files)
- Preserve all existing API endpoints, TypeScript interfaces, and streaming functionality
- Maintain responsive design and accessibility
- Keep performance optimal

Transform this from functional to premium while keeping everything working exactly as it does now.
