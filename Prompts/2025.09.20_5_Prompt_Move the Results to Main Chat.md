The accommodation search results are currently displaying in the right panel, but I need to move them to the main content area instead.

**Current Issue:**
- Search results are showing in the right panel as a compact list
- Results should display in the main central content area (where the chat and welcome message appear)
- Need visual property cards with full details, not the compact right panel format

**Required Changes:**
1. **Move results from right panel to main content area** - When search completes, display accommodation results in the central content area (replacing or appearing below the chat conversation)
2. **Create full-sized property cards** - Each result should be a proper card in the main area showing:
   - Property images/photos
   - Full property name and detailed location
   - Price per night prominently displayed
   - Star ratings with larger display
   - Key amenities list
   - AI match score and reasoning
   - "Book Now" or "View Details" buttons
3. **Right panel for progress only** - Keep the right panel focused on search progress/status, remove the results display from there
4. **Main area layout** - Use the full width of the main content area for proper accommodation browsing experience

**Goal:**
Transform the main content area into a full accommodation browsing interface with large, detailed property cards, while keeping the right panel solely for progress tracking.

Please move the results display from the right panel to the main content area with full-sized property cards.
