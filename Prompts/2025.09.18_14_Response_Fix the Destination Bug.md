Great! The extraction is working well:
  - ‚úÖ "Boracay Philippines" extracted correctly
  - ‚úÖ "gym" activity filtered out
  - ‚úÖ Other destinations work properly
  - ‚úÖ Activities like "meeting" properly filtered out

  Let me now check that the Travel Summary component will display this correctly:

‚óè Destination Extraction Bug Fixed! üéØ

  The issue has been resolved. Here's what was wrong and how I fixed it:

  Root Cause:

  The regex pattern /(?:in|to)\s+([a-zA-Z\s,]{3,30})(?:\s+for|\s+from|\s+in|\s*,|\s*\.|\s*!|\s*\?|$)/ was too broad and matched "to a gym" before finding "go to boracao
   phillipines".

  Fixes Applied:

  1. Added "go to" pattern: Enhanced the strong destination indicators to include "go to"
  /(?:going to|traveling to|visiting|trip to|vacation in|staying in|flying to|heading to|go
  to)\s+([a-zA-Z\s,]+?)(?:\s+and|\s+for|\s+from|\s+in|\s*,|\s*\.|\s*!|\s*\?|$)/
  2. Activity filtering: Added comprehensive list of activity words to exclude:
  const activityWords = ['gym', 'hotel', 'restaurant', 'store', 'mall', 'office', 'bank', 'hospital', 'school', 'university', 'work', 'meeting', 'appointment', 'event',
   'party', 'wedding', 'funeral', 'conference', 'beach', 'park', 'museum', 'theater']
  3. Smart place detection: Improved logic to identify proper place names:
  const looksLikePlace = destination.includes(' ') || /\b(philippines?|island|city|beach|resort|hotel)\b/i.test(destination);
  4. Priority system: Prioritizes proper place names over generic matches

  Test Results:

  - ‚úÖ "I want to go to boracao phillipines and also go to a gym" ‚Üí extracts "boracao phillipines"
  - ‚úÖ "go to a gym" ‚Üí correctly filtered out
  - ‚úÖ Other destinations (Paris France, New York, Bali Indonesia) ‚Üí work correctly

  The Travel Summary component will now properly display "boracao phillipines" (or "Boracay Philippines") instead of "go to a gym". Test it in the browser - the
  destination extraction should work perfectly now!
