Add two critical validation requirements to prevent agent failures:

1. Date Logic Validation:
   - Check-out date must be after check-in date
   - Both dates must be in the future (not past dates)
   - Add these to the validation logic and show clear error messages like "Check-out must be after check-in" or "Travel dates must be in the future"

2. Budget Requirement:
   - Make "maximum price per night" a required field (5th required criteria)
   - Update the validation to require budget > 0 
   - Extract budget from phrases like "under $200 per night", "max $150/night", "budget of $100 per night"
   - Update progress bar to show 0-100% across 5 criteria instead of 4
   - Add helpful hints like "Please specify your maximum budget per night"

3. Update validation messages and progress tracking:
   - Progress bar now shows 20% increments (5 criteria total)
   - Update the helper text and tooltips accordingly
   - Keep all existing visual feedback but adjust for 5 required fields

Focus on the essential validation logic - don't add extra features, just make sure these two critical requirements are enforced so the agent won't fail when it tries to search booking sites.
