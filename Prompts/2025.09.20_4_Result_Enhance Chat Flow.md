Perfect! I've made the necessary changes to clean up the chat experience:

  Changes Made:

  1. Updated AI System Prompt (/app/api/chat/route.ts):
  - Changed from technical extraction-focused to conversational travel agent
  - Added personality guidelines for warm, friendly responses
  - Explicitly instructed to avoid technical details and raw data
  - Added example responses that are natural and encouraging
  - Focused on 2-3 sentence responses with one follow-up question

  2. Enhanced Response Filtering (/lib/utils/format-response.ts):
  - Added technical pattern filtering to catch any remaining raw data
  - Filters out patterns like "Destination:", "Check-in date:", etc.
  - Removes numbered criteria lists and extraction details
  - Cleans up extra whitespace from filtered content

  3. Separation of Concerns:
  - Chat responses now focus on conversation only
  - Technical extraction still works in the background for the right panel
  - All the detailed progress tracking remains in the sidebar
  - AI responses will be natural and encouraging

  Expected Results:

  Before:
  "**Destination:** Boracay 2. **Check-in date:** 10/31 3. **Check-out date:** 11/7..."

  After:
  "Perfect! Boracay is such a beautiful destination. When are you planning to visit?"

  The right panel will continue to show all the technical details and progress, while the chat becomes a clean, professional conversation experience like talking to a
  real travel agent.
