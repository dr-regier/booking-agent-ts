Add functionality to extract and track travel criteria from the user's messages. Create:

1. A TypeScript interface for TravelCriteria with fields: destination, checkIn, checkOut, guests, budget, amenities
2. A component that displays the collected criteria in a sidebar or summary card
3. Logic to parse user messages and extract travel information (destination, dates, guest count, budget)
4. Update the chat to show "Travel Summary" with the criteria we've collected so far
5. Make the criteria display update as the conversation progresses

I want to see the travel details being captured and displayed as we chat.
