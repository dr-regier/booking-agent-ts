Enhance the chat interface to gather additional context that will help the agent provide more accurate accommodation results:

1. After Required Criteria Collection:
   - Once the user provides the 5 required criteria (destination, dates, guests, budget), keep the chat active
   - Add a new phase that asks intelligent follow-up questions to improve search quality
   - Don't enable the search button immediately - wait for enhanced criteria collection

2. Implement Smart Follow-up Questions:
   - Trip purpose: "What's the purpose of your trip?" (business, vacation, romantic, family, etc.)
   - Location preferences: "Any preferences for neighborhood or proximity?" (nightlife, quiet, near transit, walkable, etc.)
   - Must-have amenities: "Any essential amenities you need?" (kitchen, parking, wifi, gym, pool, etc.)
   - Property type preference: "What type of accommodation do you prefer?" (hotel, apartment, unique stays, etc.)
   - Booking flexibility: "Do you need flexible cancellation policies?"

3. Enhanced Criteria Tracking:
   - Extend the TravelCriteria interface to include these optional enhanced fields
   - Update the Travel Summary to show both required and optional criteria
   - Add a "Enhanced Context" section showing the additional preferences collected

4. Progressive Search Enablement:
   - After required criteria: Show "Continue conversation to improve results" instead of enabling search immediately
   - After some enhanced criteria: Enable search with text like "Start Search (Enhanced)" 
   - Allow users to skip enhanced questions and search with just basics if they want

5. Conversational Flow:
   - Make it feel natural - not like a form, but like talking to a knowledgeable travel agent
   - Extract enhanced criteria from natural conversation responses
   - Show progress on both required (5/5) and enhanced criteria (3/8 optional) collection

The goal is to gather rich context that will help the Playwright agent make smarter filtering and ranking decisions when it actually searches the booking sites.
