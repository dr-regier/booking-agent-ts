Optimize the AI response speed by:

1. Switch to GPT-3.5-turbo model instead of GPT-4 or GPT-5 for faster responses
2. Reduce max_tokens to 300-500 (travel questions don't need long responses)
3. Trim the system prompt to essential formatting instructions only
4. Limit conversation history to last 5-10 message exchanges to reduce context size
5. Add a timeout setting (10-15 seconds max) with error handling

The goal is sub-10 second response times while maintaining response quality.
