Fix the travel criteria extraction and UI display issues based on the user feedback:

1. Enhance Enhanced Context Extraction:
   - The user provided rich details but only showing "3/5" enhanced context
   - Extract and display more specific preferences mentioned: "full kitchen", "apartment/house only", "queen bed", "AC", "strong wifi", "gym nearby", "no hotels"
   - Improve parsing to capture accommodation type preferences (apartment vs hotel)
   - Better extraction of specific amenity requirements (kitchen type, bed size, etc.)

2. Improve Enhanced Context Display:
   - Show more extracted preference tags instead of just "walkable, beach, quiet"
   - Add tags for: "full kitchen", "queen bed", "apartment only", "gym nearby", "AC required", etc.
   - Organize tags by category (accommodation type, amenities, location preferences)
   - Update the enhanced context counter to reflect the actual amount of detail provided

3. Fix Validation Logic:
   - Don't show green checkmarks until criteria are properly extracted
   - Ensure validation reflects actual extracted data, not partial matches
   - Fix any cases where validation shows complete but extraction is incomplete

4. Visual Improvements:
   - Make the Enhanced Context section more prominent since it contains valuable agent data
   - Remove or update the "Tell me about trip purpose" prompt if sufficient context has been provided
   - Better organize the Travel Summary to show the wealth of information collected

The goal is to accurately capture and display all the detailed preferences the user provided so the Playwright agent has comprehensive search criteria.
