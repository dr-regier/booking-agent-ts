Improve the AI response formatting with both system prompt instructions and chat display styling:

1. Update System Prompt Instructions:
   - Add formatting guidelines that tell the AI to structure responses clearly
   - Instruct it to use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
   - Tell it to format questions as numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) rather than long paragraphs
   - Ask it to use bullet points for amenities, options, or lists
   - Request brief acknowledgments followed by organized questions
   - Example instruction: "Format your responses with short paragraphs, numbered questions, and clear structure. Avoid long blocks of text."

2. Enhance Chat Message Display Styling:
   - Improve typography for AI messages with better line height and spacing
   - Add proper paragraph breaks and margins between sections
   - Style numbered lists and bullet points clearly
   - Increase readability with better text formatting
   - Make sure long responses are visually digestible

3. Add Response Processing:
   - Process AI responses to automatically add proper line breaks
   - Convert numbered items into proper formatted lists
   - Split overly long paragraphs automatically
   - Ensure consistent spacing throughout the response

4. Target Format Example:
   - Brief acknowledgment paragraph
   - Numbered questions with clear spacing
   - Bullet points for lists/options
   - Short, focused paragraphs throughout

The goal is to transform ugly wall-of-text responses into clean, professional, easily readable travel agent conversations.
