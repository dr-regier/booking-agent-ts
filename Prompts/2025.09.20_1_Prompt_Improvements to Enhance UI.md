I have two layout issues that need fixing in the current design:

1. **Black Textarea Problem**: The dark input area looks jarring against the clean, light travel design. We tried 10 times to fix text visibility issues with transparent backgrounds, so we need a solution that maintains high contrast while fitting the aesthetic.

2. **Content Overflow Issue**: The main "Welcome to your Travel Assistant" content area is already scrolling when it should fit comfortably in the available space. The layout calculations seem off.

**Fix Requirements:**

**For the Black Textarea:**
- Replace black background with a light, travel-appropriate alternative
- Try: solid light gray (`bg-gray-50` or `bg-gray-100`), white with dark border (`bg-white border-2 border-gray-300`), or subtle blue tint (`bg-blue-50`)
- Ensure dark text remains highly readable
- Must maintain the clean, cohesive travel aesthetic

**For the Content Overflow:**
- Fix the main content area so the welcome message fits without scrolling
- Reduce padding/margins in the main content container
- Optimize vertical spacing between elements
- Consider adjusting text sizes if needed
- Ensure proper height calculations for the layout

**Goals:**
- Eliminate the jarring black input field
- Make the main content area fit properly without premature scrolling
- Maintain the professional, travel-focused aesthetic
- Keep all text highly readable and accessible

Please analyze the current layout structure and fix both of these issues while preserving the excellent travel-themed design we just achieved.
