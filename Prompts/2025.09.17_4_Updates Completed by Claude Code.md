Perfect! I've successfully implemented the streaming accommodation search functionality. Here's what I created:

  âœ… New Features Implemented:

  1. Streaming Search API (/app/api/search-accommodations/route.ts)

  - Server-Sent Events for real-time progress updates
  - Mock accommodation database with properties for Paris, New York, Tokyo, and default locations
  - Budget filtering based on user criteria
  - Progressive search simulation with realistic timing delays
  - Structured accommodation data with ratings, amenities, and descriptions

  2. Search Components (/components/search-accommodations.tsx)

  - SearchAccommodations: Button component with real-time progress display
  - SearchResults: Card-based results display with ratings and amenities
  - Streaming progress tracking that shows each search step
  - Error handling and loading states

  3. Enhanced Main Interface (/app/page.tsx)

  - Integrated search functionality in the sidebar
  - Real-time results display alongside travel criteria
  - Scrollable sidebar to handle multiple results

  ðŸ”„ How the Streaming Search Works:

  1. User clicks "Start Accommodation Search" (requires minimum criteria like destination)
  2. Progress updates stream in real-time:
    - "Starting accommodation search..."
    - "Searching Booking.com..."
    - "Searching Airbnb..."
    - "Searching Hotels.com..."
    - "Analyzing X properties found..."
    - "Generating personalized recommendations..."
    - "Finalizing search results..."
  3. Final results display with hotel cards showing:
    - Hotel name and location
    - Star ratings and pricing
    - Detailed descriptions
    - Amenity badges
    - Clear results with expand/collapse

  ðŸ§ª Ready to Test:

  Visit http://localhost:3001 and try:

  1. Enter travel criteria like: "Looking for hotels in Paris for 2 guests with budget under $300"
  2. Watch the Travel Summary populate automatically
  3. Click "Start Accommodation Search" to see the streaming progress
  4. View real-time results as they populate in the sidebar

  The search will show realistic progress updates and return mock accommodations relevant to your destination and budget!
