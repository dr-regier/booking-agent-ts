Perfect! I've successfully implemented the critical validation requirements to prevent agent failures. Here's what I added:

  ✅ Critical Validation Features Implemented:

  1. Date Logic Validation

  - ✅ Future Dates Only: Both check-in and check-out must be in the future
  - ✅ Check-out After Check-in: Check-out date must be after check-in date
  - ✅ Clear Error Messages:
    - "Check-in date must be in the future"
    - "Check-out date must be in the future"
    - "Check-out date must be after check-in date"

  2. Budget Requirement (5th Required Criteria)

  - ✅ Maximum Budget Per Night: Now required for search
  - ✅ Enhanced Budget Extraction: Detects phrases like:
    - "under $200 per night"
    - "max $150/night"
    - "budget of $100 per night"
    - "$80 nightly"
  - ✅ Validation: Budget must be > 0

  3. Updated Progress Tracking

  - ✅ 5 Criteria Total: Progress bar now shows 20% increments (100% ÷ 5)
  - ✅ Updated UI: Shows "Budget Per Night" as 5th requirement
  - ✅ Real-time Error Display: Red error boxes show date/budget validation issues

  🚦 Enhanced Validation System:

  Required Criteria (All 5 Must Be Met):

  1. Destination - Valid location name
  2. Check-in Date - Future date
  3. Check-out Date - Future date, after check-in
  4. Number of Guests - Must be > 0
  5. Budget Per Night - Maximum price must be > 0

  Error Prevention:

  - Date Parser: Handles MM/DD/YYYY, MM/DD, "March 15th" formats
  - Logic Validation: Prevents impossible date combinations
  - Budget Extraction: Prioritizes "per night" amounts over total budgets
  - Visual Feedback: Red error messages appear immediately when validation fails

  🧪 Test Scenarios:

  Visit http://localhost:3001 and try these to see validation:

  ✅ Valid Flow:

  1. "Going to Paris" → 20% (1/5)
  2. "from March 25th to March 28th" → 60% (3/5)
  3. "for 2 people" → 80% (4/5)
  4. "budget under $200 per night" → 100% ✅ Search enabled!

  ❌ Error Testing:

  - "from March 1st to March 3rd" → Shows "Check-in date must be in the future"
  - "from March 25th to March 20th" → Shows "Check-out date must be after check-in date"
  - Missing budget → Shows "Please specify maximum budget per night"

  The system now prevents all the critical agent failure scenarios by enforcing proper date logic and budget requirements!
