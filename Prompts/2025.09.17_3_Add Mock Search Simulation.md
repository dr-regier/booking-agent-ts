Create a new API route `/api/search-accommodations` that simulates a travel search process:

1. Accept travel criteria as POST parameters
2. Return a streaming response that shows search progress like:
   - "Starting accommodation search..."
   - "Searching Booking.com..."  
   - "Searching Airbnb..."
   - "Analyzing 12 properties found..."
   - "Generating recommendations..."
3. End with mock accommodation results (3-5 properties with name, price, rating, description)
4. Add a "Start Search" button to the chat interface that triggers this search
5. Display the streaming progress in the chat and show results when complete

Use Server-Sent Events or similar for the real-time progress updates.
