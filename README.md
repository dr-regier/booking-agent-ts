# AI-Powered Travel Booking Assistant

An intelligent travel booking assistant that combines conversational AI with automated web scraping to provide personalized accommodation recommendations. Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and advanced browser automation.

## üöÄ Key Features

### **Conversational AI Interface**
- Natural language processing for travel criteria extraction
- Context-aware responses using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini
- Real-time typewriter animations for enhanced UX
- Intelligent parsing of complex travel requests

### **Automated Web Scraping**
- **Playwright automation** for real-time data collection
- **Anti-detection mechanisms** with human-like behavior simulation
- **Multi-platform integration**: Booking.com, Airbnb, Hotels.com
- **Intelligent retry logic** for handling rate limits

### **Dual-Mode Architecture**
- **Mock Mode**: Sample data for safe demonstration
- **Production Mode**: Live web scraping with real accommodation data
- **Environment-based switching** for seamless transitions

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dr-regier/booking-agent-ts.git
cd booking-agent-ts
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment Setup
Create `.env.local` file:
```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env.local
```

### 4. Start Development
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to start chatting with the AI assistant.

## Testing Modes

This application supports two modes for accommodation search:

### Mock Mode (Default)
- Uses sample accommodation data for demonstration
- No real booking sites are accessed
- Perfect for testing and portfolio showcasing
- **Default behavior** - no additional setup required

### Production Mode
- Uses real Playwright automation to search actual booking sites
- Provides live accommodation data from Booking.com, Airbnb, etc.
- **To enable:** Add this line to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
USE_REAL_BOOKING_SEARCH=true
```
Then restart the development server with `pnpm dev`.

**Note:** Production mode requires additional dependencies and may have longer response times due to real-time web scraping.
