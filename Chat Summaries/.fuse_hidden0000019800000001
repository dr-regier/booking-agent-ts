# AI Booking Agent Project Summary (as of 2025-09-21)

## Project Overview
- TypeScript/Next.js accommodation booking agent with conversational AI interface, intelligent Playwright automation, and GPT-4 property evaluation
- Current phase: Demo mode fully polished and ready for bootcamp submission

## Technical Status
- **Implemented**: Complete chat interface with real-time criteria extraction, professional travel-themed UI, Server-Sent Events for progress tracking, Playwright automation with human-like workflows, GPT-4o-mini integration for chat and property evaluation
- **Current blockers**: None - demo experience is complete and functional
- **Recent changes**: Fixed all progress indicator synchronization issues, reduced text input area size for better screen efficiency, optimized send button positioning

## Architecture & Decisions
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript, shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS, compact chat interface design
- **AI Integration**: GPT-4o-mini for conversational AI + separate instance for property evaluation and scoring
- **Automation**: Playwright with sophisticated human-like workflows including form filling, filter selection, scrolling, and review analysis
- **Progress Tracking**: Server-Sent Events with synchronized main progress indicators and detailed progress updates
- **Mode Strategy**: Environment-based switching (USE_REAL_BOOKING_SEARCH) between demo mode (default) and production mode

## Constraints & Requirements
- **Demo vs Production**: Demo mode uses mock data for portfolio presentation, production mode runs real 10-20 minute searches with anti-detection measures
- **Property Evaluation**: 2-3 minutes per property for thorough AI assessment with match scoring
- **Output Format**: AccommodationResult objects with aiReasoning, matchScore, bookingUrl fields
- **Target Platforms**: Booking.com, Airbnb, Hotels.com integration

## Open Questions
- Production mode real-world testing and reliability validation
- Anti-detection effectiveness in live environments
- Final presentation strategy and documentation approach

## Immediate Next Actions
1. **Test production mode** - Validate real Playwright automation workflows after demo polish completion
2. **Prepare comprehensive documentation** - Create README explaining demo vs production capabilities
3. **Add result validation** - Implement filtering for properties with missing data or unrealistic pricing
4. **Bootcamp submission preparation** - Finalize presentation materials and technical documentation

## Context for Future Chats
- **Key files**: `/api/search-accommodations/route.ts` (main search logic), `/lib/utils/travel-extractor.ts` (criteria extraction)
- **UI state**: Professional travel theme with optimized compact chat interface and synchronized progress tracking
- **Demo script**: Prepared for recorded presentation emphasizing intelligent browsing automation and AI match scoring
- **Technical focus**: Human-like Playwright workflows, real-time progress synchronization, AI-powered property evaluation system
