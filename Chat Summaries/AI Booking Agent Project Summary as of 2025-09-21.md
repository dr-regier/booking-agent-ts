# AI Booking Agent Project Summary (as of 2025-09-21)

## Project Overview
- TypeScript/Next.js accommodation booking agent with chat interface, Playwright automation, and AI-powered property evaluation
- Current phase: Demo mode polished, ready for production testing and bootcamp submission

## Technical Status
- **Implemented**: Complete chat interface, real-time criteria extraction, professional travel-themed UI, Playwright automation agent, GPT-4o-mini AI evaluation
- **Current issues**: Minor bugs in demo mode progress/results sync that need fixing before production testing
- **Recent changes**: Major UI redesign from purple gaming aesthetic to professional travel theme, optimized spacing for better screen efficiency

## Architecture & Decisions
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Server-Sent Events for streaming
- **AI Integration**: GPT-4o-mini for chat + separate instance for property evaluation (upgraded from GPT-3.5-turbo)
- **Automation**: Playwright with stealth configurations, human-like browsing patterns
- **Mode switching**: Environment-based (USE_REAL_BOOKING_SEARCH=true for production, demo mode default)

## Constraints & Requirements
- **Demo vs Production**: Demo mode uses mock data for portfolio/bootcamp presentation, production mode runs 10-20 minute real searches
- **Evaluation time**: 2-3 minutes per property for thorough AI assessment
- **Output format**: AccommodationResult with aiReasoning, matchScore, bookingUrl fields
- **Platforms**: Booking.com + Airbnb primary targets

## Open Questions
- Production mode testing results and reliability
- Real-world anti-detection effectiveness
- Final presentation strategy for bootcamp submission

## Immediate Next Actions
1. **Fix demo mode bugs** - Resolve progress/results synchronization issues before production testing
2. **Perfect demo UX** - Ensure flawless user experience flow for portfolio presentation
3. **Test production mode** - Validate real Playwright automation after demo is polished
4. **Add result validation** - Implement basic checks to filter out properties with missing data or unrealistic prices
5. **Prepare documentation** - README explaining demo vs production modes for submission

## Context for Future Chats
- **Key files**: `/api/search-accommodations/route.ts`, `/lib/utils/travel-extractor.ts`
- **UI state**: Professional travel theme with optimized spacing, results display in main content area
- **Submission strategy**: Keep demo mode as default for GitHub, document production capabilities
- **Current focus**: Demo mode polish before production validation
- **AI model**: Already upgraded to GPT-4o-mini throughout codebase
