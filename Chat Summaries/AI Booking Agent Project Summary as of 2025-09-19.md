# AI Booking Agent Project Summary (as of 2025-09-19)

## Project Overview
- TypeScript/Next.js accommodation booking agent with chat interface and Playwright automation for real booking site interaction
- Ready to implement sophisticated browser automation agent with AI-powered property evaluation

## Technical Status
- **Implemented**: Full chat interface with conversation history, real-time criteria extraction (5 core + 15 enhanced), streaming search UI, split-screen layout
- **Current phase**: Ready to replace mock search with Playwright automation agent
- **Recent changes**: Fixed layout for simultaneous criteria/chat visibility, enhanced system prompt for booking focus

## Architecture & Decisions
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Server-Sent Events for streaming progress
- **AI Integration**: GPT-3.5-turbo (400 token limit, 10-message history) for chat, separate GPT-3.5-turbo for agent property evaluation
- **Agent Strategy**: Hybrid intelligence (rule-based filtering + AI ranking), headless Playwright automation
- **Multi-site approach**: Booking.com + Airbnb primary, expandable to Hotels.com/Expedia

## Constraints & Requirements
- **Evaluation time**: 10-20 minutes for thorough, human-like property review (2-3 min per property)
- **Output format**: Enhanced AccommodationResult with aiReasoning, matchScore, bookingUrl fields
- **Core criteria**: destination, check-in/out dates, guests, budget per night
- **Stealth requirements**: Realistic browsing patterns, anti-detection measures

## Open Questions
- Browser automation testing strategy and development environment setup
- Real-world anti-detection effectiveness on booking sites
- Property evaluation depth vs automation reliability balance

## Immediate Next Actions
1. **Implement Playwright agent** using comprehensive Claude Code prompt (replaces mock search in route.ts)
2. **Test with headed mode** to debug form filling and data extraction
3. **Integrate streaming progress** updates during automation phases
4. **Validate enhanced AccommodationResult** format and AI reasoning quality
5. **Switch to headless mode** for production portfolio presentation

## Context for Future Chats
- **Key files**: `/api/search-accommodations/route.ts` (current mock), `/lib/utils/travel-extractor.ts` (criteria parsing)
- **Interface**: TravelCriteria input, AccommodationResult[] output with AI evaluation fields
- **Portfolio focus**: Personal tool showcasing sophisticated automation + AI decision-making
- **Performance**: Sub-3s chat responses, 10-20min thorough agent searches
