# AI Travel Agent Project Summary (as of 2025-09-18)

## Project Overview
- TypeScript/Next.js travel agent that collects user criteria via chat and will perform autonomous accommodation searches
- Currently in UI/data collection phase, ready for Playwright browser automation implementation

## Technical Status
- **Implemented**: Full chat interface, real-time criteria extraction, streaming search UI, comprehensive validation
- **Current blocker**: Need to implement Playwright automation for actual booking site searches
- **Recent changes**: Optimized AI responses (40s→2.2s), enhanced criteria extraction with 15-point scoring system

## Architecture & Decisions
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript, shadcn/ui components, real-time Server-Sent Events
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo (switched from GPT-5 for speed), 400 token limit, 10-message history
- **Data Flow**: Chat → criteria extraction → validation → streaming search simulation → (future: Playwright automation)
- **Browser automation choice**: Playwright selected over Puppeteer for better modern site handling

## Constraints & Requirements
- **Validation requirements**: 5 mandatory criteria (destination, check-in, check-out, guests, budget per night)
- **Enhanced context**: 15-point system capturing amenities, property types, location preferences, exclusions
- **Performance target**: Sub-3 second AI response times achieved
- **User experience**: Professional formatting with numbered lists, bullet points, proper spacing

## Open Questions
- **Anti-detection strategy**: How aggressive should stealth techniques be for booking sites?
- **Site prioritization**: Start with Booking.com only or implement multi-site search immediately?
- **Error handling**: Fallback strategies when sites change layouts or block requests
- **Data storage**: How to persist search results and user preferences?

## Immediate Next Actions
1. **Implement Playwright automation** in `/api/search-accommodations/route.ts` to replace mock data
2. **Navigate booking sites**: Handle dynamic forms, date pickers, filters
3. **Extract real accommodation data**: Property details, pricing, availability
4. **Integrate with streaming UI**: Update progress during actual web automation
5. **Add error handling**: Graceful failures, timeouts, site changes

## Context for Future Chats
- **Key files**: `/api/search-accommodations/route.ts` (mock search), `/lib/utils/travel-extractor.ts` (criteria parsing)
- **Architecture**: Server-Sent Events for progress, TravelCriteria interface with enhanced context
- **UI state**: Button progression (disabled → basic search → enhanced search) based on 5+15 criteria system
- **Performance**: GPT-3.5-turbo with 400 tokens, 15s timeout, 10-message history limit
